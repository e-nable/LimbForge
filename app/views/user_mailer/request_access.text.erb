Hey Admin,

<%= @user.email %> wants access to the Limbforge tool. If you don't want to give them access please ignore this message.
If you do want to give them access and to notify them of their access, go to the Limbforge.org admin dashboard at <%= ActionMailer::Base.default_url_options[:host] %> and visit the "access requests" tab.

Happy <%= DateTime.current.strftime('%A') %>,
